#### Special Case
##### Using Two Base Cases
![[FP1 Induction WS 2_1.pdf]]
This works as since $P_1$ is true and $P_2$ is true, then, by using $n=k+2$, we can get to any integer, and as $P_k \Rightarrow P_{k+2}$, we know that it will be true for that integer.
- With **$k=1$**, $n=1+2=3$
- With **$k=2$**, $n=2+2=4$
- With **$k=3$**, $n=3+2=5$  `(we have established that P₃ is true as P₁ ⇒ P₃)`
- $…$
